10  int[]* is incompatible with int*


35 since copy constructor is deleted, there is no matching function to call
same with 37
39 since Derived's destructor is not declared virtual, delete bPtr
will only call Base's destructor but not Derived's destructor, leading
 to memory leak

Assigning d4 with d3 on line 37 may cause d3's Derived::p and Base::p to be deleted twice.
Same with 35.

MISTAKES:
- Cannot initialize d using parenthesis notation.
- BASE destructor needs to be declared virtual
- default argument (n = 0), when ommited, raises amibuguity about
which function to call
- deleting new int with delete [] p would cause problems for
deallocation
